export const FAQ_DATA = [
  {
    q: 'What is Hookpost?',
    a: `Hookpost is an open-source social media management and scheduling platform from Hookstep, founded by Mohan Bhanushali. It publishes to ${PUBLISHABLE_CHANNEL_COUNT} networks from one visual calendar, ships a native Model Context Protocol (MCP) server so Claude Code, Cursor and Windsurf can draft and queue posts directly, is licensed under AGPL-3.0, and self-hosts with Docker. Billing runs through Razorpay, so UPI, NetBanking and cards all work.`,
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I self-host Hookpost with Docker for free?',
    a: 'Yes. Hookpost is licensed under AGPL-3.0 and self-hosts with `docker compose up -d`, running the whole stack (Next.js frontend, NestJS backend, Temporal orchestrator, PostgreSQL, and Redis) on your own VPS with no per-seat or per-channel fees. The public source release is not out yet, so the repository is shared on request rather than by public clone - ask via our about page and we will send it over with a deployment key.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does Hookpost support AI agents, Claude, and Model Context Protocol (MCP)?',
    a: 'Yes. Hookpost ships with an official MCP server (`npx hookpost`) and terminal CLI that connects directly to Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, OpenClaw, and ChatGPT. AI agents can inspect connected channels, draft multi-network posts with platform-specific constraints, generate AI graphics, and schedule posts automatically via standard MCP tools.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does Hookpost support Indian payment methods like UPI and Razorpay?',
    a: `Yes. Hookpost is priced in rupees, starting at \u20b9${pricing.STANDARD.month_price.toLocaleString('en-IN')}/month, with native UPI (Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm), NetBanking, and Indian cards processed securely via Razorpay.`,
  },
  {
    q: 'Can Hookpost auto-repeat or recycle evergreen posts?',
    a: 'Yes. Any post can be set to repeat on a schedule, so your best-performing content keeps going out without you copy-pasting it every month. Pick the post, set the cadence (for example, every 30 days), choose which channels it should hit each time, and Hookpost handles the rest. Each repost shows up in your calendar so you can still see, edit, or pause upcoming runs. On Team, Pro, and Ultimate plans you can also auto-post from an RSS feed, which is handy for turning a blog or newsletter into a steady social cadence.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does Hookpost have a public API and webhooks?',
    a: `Yes. Every paid plan includes a REST API for creating posts, uploading media, and managing integrations — useful if you want to plug Hookpost into your own tools, n8n, Zapier, or a custom dashboard. Webhooks are included from Standard and up, with the monthly allowance scaling by plan: Standard ${pricing.STANDARD.webhooks}, Pro ${pricing.PRO.webhooks}. Combined with the public API, they let you trigger posts automatically from CI, a CMS, or any event source.`,
  },
  {
    q: 'What analytics does Hookpost provide?',
    a: "Hookpost shows per-channel and per-post analytics pulled from each network's official insights API. Depending on the channel, you'll see impressions, likes, comments, shares, reach, and engagement rate. Everything is in one dashboard — you can compare how the same post performed on LinkedIn vs. X vs. Instagram without opening five different apps. Analytics coverage depends on what each platform exposes publicly.",
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I cross-post the same content to multiple platforms at once?',
    a: "Yes — that's the core of Hookpost. Write a post once, pick the channels, and Hookpost publishes to all of them at the time you choose. Before scheduling, each channel gets its own preview so you can tweak copy, media, or hashtags per platform — for example, a longer LinkedIn version and a shorter X version of the same post. You can also queue the same post to re-run on an evergreen schedule.",
  },
  {
    q: 'What AI features does Hookpost include?',
    a: `Hookpost ships with a built-in AI agent that can draft posts and generate images — all from one chat window. AI text generates hooks, captions, threads and hashtags tuned per platform (included on every paid plan; monthly allowance: Standard ${pricing.STANDARD.ai_generation_count.toLocaleString('en-IN')}, Pro ${pricing.PRO.ai_generation_count.toLocaleString('en-IN')}). AI images generate visuals directly from a prompt (Standard ${pricing.STANDARD.image_generation_count}, Pro ${pricing.PRO.image_generation_count}). You can also chat with the agent to schedule posts end-to-end.`,
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I manage multiple brands or clients from a single Hookpost account?',
    a: 'Yes. On Team, Pro, and Ultimate plans you can organize your connected accounts into customer groups, so each brand or client has its own clean workspace inside one Hookpost login. Each customer group keeps its own channels, calendar, and analytics — useful for agencies, freelancers, or anyone running several brands.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How many team members can I invite, and what can they do?',
    a: 'Team, Pro, and Ultimate plans let you invite unlimited team members by email. Standard is a solo plan. Hookpost has two roles: Admin (manage channels, billing, and team settings) and Member (draft, schedule, and review posts). Everyone works from the same visual calendar, so drafts, scheduled posts, and analytics stay in one place.',
  },
  {
    q: "How much does Hookpost cost, and what's included in each plan?",
    a: `Hookpost has two paid plans plus a free tier, with monthly or annual billing (saving ~20%). Free is ₹0 for ${pricing.FREE.channel} channels and ${pricing.FREE.posts_per_month} posts a month. Standard is ₹${pricing.STANDARD.month_price.toLocaleString('en-IN')}/mo for ${pricing.STANDARD.channel} channels, ${pricing.STANDARD.posts_per_month.toLocaleString('en-IN')} posts/month, ${pricing.STANDARD.ai_generation_count.toLocaleString('en-IN')} AI text generations, ${pricing.STANDARD.image_generation_count} AI images, ${pricing.STANDARD.generate_videos ? pricing.STANDARD.generate_videos + ' AI videos, ' : ''}API, and ${pricing.STANDARD.webhooks} webhooks. Pro is ₹${pricing.PRO.month_price.toLocaleString('en-IN')}/mo for ${pricing.PRO.channel} channels, ${pricing.PRO.posts_per_month.toLocaleString('en-IN')} posts/month, team members, ${pricing.PRO.ai_generation_count.toLocaleString('en-IN')} AI text generations, ${pricing.PRO.image_generation_count} AI images, ${pricing.PRO.generate_videos ? pricing.PRO.generate_videos + ' AI videos, ' : ''}and ${pricing.PRO.webhooks} webhooks.`,
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I swap or change my connected channels after choosing a plan?',
    a: `Yes. You are never locked into any specific set of channels. Connect, disconnect, and swap any of the ${CHANNEL_COUNT} supported networks at any time, as long as your total active channels stay within your plan's limit. If you downgrade and exceed the new limit, Hookpost automatically disables the most recent connections without deleting data.`,
  },
  {
    q: 'If I connect 3 Facebook pages, does that count as 1 channel or 3?',
    a: `Each connected social account, profile, or page counts as one channel slot. So three Facebook pages count as three channels. Channel allowances are: Free (${pricing.FREE.channel} channels), Standard (${pricing.STANDARD.channel} channels) and Pro (${pricing.PRO.channel} channels).`,
  },
