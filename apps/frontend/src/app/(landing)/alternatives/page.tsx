              This claimed benchmarks "conducted by the Hookstep
              engineering team" measuring API reliability, queue execution
              latency and AI copilot output quality. No such benchmark is
              published, there is no methodology and no data, and there is no
              author page behind it. An authority claim a reader cannot check
              is worth less than no claim - and on pages whose whole job is to
              be believed about a competitor, it is actively costly.

              Replaced with what is actually true and checkable: these
              comparisons come from the competitors' own public pricing pages
              and public API documentation, and they are dated.
            */}
            Every competitor figure on these pages is taken from that
            competitor's own public pricing page or public API documentation,
            and is dated where it appears so you can check it against the
            source. Where a competitor prices per channel or per seat, we say
            so and state the billing basis, because monthly and annual rates
            differ. We do not publish performance benchmarks; where a
            capability is comparable, we mark it as a tie rather than claiming
            a win.
