            The social media scheduling market in 2026 splits three ways: per-seat suites like <strong>Hootsuite</strong> ($99 per user per month billed annually), cloud schedulers like <strong>Publer</strong> (from $4 per channel per month billed yearly, with a free plan), and self-hostable tools like <strong>Mixpost</strong> (free MIT Lite edition; Pro is a $299 one-time licence) and <strong>Postiz</strong> (AGPL-3.0; hosted plans from $23/mo billed yearly). Prices checked 26 September 2026.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm sm:text-base text-white/70 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Hookpost</strong> is built on Postiz's AGPL-3.0 code. It adds rupee billing through Razorpay (UPI &amp; cards), a hosted free plan ({FREE.channel} channels, {FREE.posts_per_month} posts a month), and paid plans from {inr(STD_INR.month_price)} / ${STD_USD.month_price} a month. Like Postiz, it ships an MCP server for Claude &amp; Cursor.

          <p className="text-[#d1d1d1] text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Hookpost is built on Postiz's open-source (AGPL-3.0) code, so the two share their scheduling engine and both ship an MCP server. Hookpost adds Razorpay UPI and card billing in rupees and a hosted free plan, and publishes to {PUBLISHABLE_CHANNEL_COUNT} networks today.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm text-white/50 pt-1">
            Hookpost publishes to X, LinkedIn, YouTube, Facebook Pages, Bluesky, Discord, Slack, Telegram, WordPress, Hashnode, Dev.to, Lemmy, Nostr and Listmonk. Instagram and Threads are waiting on Meta approval, so Postiz is the better fit today if those are your main channels.
