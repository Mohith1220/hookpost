              Hookpost is a software service delivered entirely over the
              internet. There is no physical product, no courier, no tracking
              number and no delivery address. We do not ship goods, and no
              shipping charges are ever added to your order.

              How delivery works
            </h2>
            <p className="mt-3">
              Delivery is the activation of your plan on your Hookpost account.
              When a payment succeeds, the plan is applied to your account
              immediately &mdash; normally within a few seconds of Razorpay
              confirming the payment, and in all cases within 24 hours. You do
              not need to do anything to receive it: sign in and the new limits,
              channels and features are already there.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              A payment receipt is emailed to the address on your account. Your
              plan, billing period and renewal date are always visible inside
              the app under billing.

            <p className="mt-3">
              Hookpost is available worldwide wherever the social networks we
              support are accessible. Because delivery is digital, there are no
              regional shipping restrictions and no customs, duties or import
              charges.
