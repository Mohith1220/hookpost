# is http://localhost:3000 and NEXT_PUBLIC_FACEBOOK_PIXEL / NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_ID
# do not exist at all. Building without this step shipped a production bundle
# that called localhost for every API request and had the pixel and the Google
# tag compiled out - and nothing failed loudly, because an unset NEXT_PUBLIC_*
# inlines as an empty string and the tracking components simply return null.
#
# The VM's .env is the single source of truth, so read it from there every time
# rather than keeping a second copy here that drifts.
